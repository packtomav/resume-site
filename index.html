	                He is a diligent and dedicated staffer that works hard to fulfill his duties. 
	                He's taken on multiple leadership roles in the newsroom that required 
	                him to learn new skills in a short amount of time, which he did successfully. 
	                He is a team player that recognizes the bigger picture of his responsibilities 
	                and will be an asset to any future employer."
